# Global_OCpetro_Oxidation

This repository contains the code and data for the manuscript "Global CO2 release by rock organic carbon oxidation negates silicate weathering" by Jesse R. Zondervan, Robert G. Hilton, Fiona Clubb, Mathieu Dellinger, Tobias Roylands, Mateja Ogriƒç.

This repository contains the code only and a link to the python environment and the data used to generate the final global OCpetro oxidation model.

The code was developed in a python environment detailed in anaconda-project.yml and which has been uploaded with all its dependencies to Zenodo. There is no need to pull modules from mirrors. The code file is "Glob_newmethod_parr_globalresidual.py" in this repository.

A permanent DOI was created through Zenodo and can be found here: 

## Data
Data needed to run this code is uploaded and available on Zenodo. To run the code with available data in a functional environment, it is advised to download the files, code and environment from Zenodo. Anaconda-project can be used to unpack the zip file and to run the model.
